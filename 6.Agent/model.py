- webpack.config.js (proper configuration for development)
- .babelrc (proper React presets)
- public/index.html (with proper root div)
- src/index.js (React 18 setup)
- src/App.js (main component)
- Any additional components needed

For package.json, include these scripts:

    "start": "webpack serve --mode development --open",
    "build": "webpack --mode production"

    static: {

    },
    port: 3000,
    hot: true
}

Include all necessary dependencies like react, react-dom, webpack, babel, etc.
The app must work immediately with `npm install` and `npm start`.
